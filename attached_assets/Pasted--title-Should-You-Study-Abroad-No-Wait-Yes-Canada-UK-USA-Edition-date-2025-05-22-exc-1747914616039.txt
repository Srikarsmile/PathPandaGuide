Still here? Great—because for many students the real answer quickly becomes **“Yes!”**, especially when we’re talking about top-ranked universities in **Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States**. Let’s bust the biggest myths one by one.

* **USA** – Many universities offer generous merit scholarships; some cover **50 – 100 %** of tuition.

## Myth 2: “A local degree is safer for my career.”

Employers love international grads because they can **adapt, solve problems and work with different cultures**.
